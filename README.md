Bubblejail is a [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap)-based alternative to Firejail.

## Description

Bubblejail's design is based on observations of Firejail's faults.

One of the biggest issues with Firejail is that you can accidentally run unsandboxed applications and not notice.

Bubblejail, instead of trying to transparently overlay an existing home directory, creates a separate home directory.

Every **Instance** represents a separate home directory. Typically, every sandboxed application has its own home directory.

Each instance has a `services.toml` file which defines the configuration of the instance such as system resources that the sandbox should have access to.

**Service** represents some system resources that the sandbox can be given access to. For example, the Pulse Audio service gives access to the Pulse Audio socket so that the application can use sound.

**Profile** is a predefined set of services that a particular application uses. Using profiles is entirely optional.

* XDG D-Bus Proxy - filtering dbus proxy
* Desktop File Utils - to manipulate default applications
* Python udev - device detection
* Python Qt5 - for GUI
* Meson - build system

* libseccomp - helper library for seccomp rules
* notify-send - command to send desktop notification (part of `libnotify`)

Optional:

* bash-completion - auto-completions for bash shell
* fish - auto-completions for fish shell

#### Using meson to install

1. Run `meson setup build` to setup build directory

## Quick start

1. Install bubblejail from [AUR git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bubblejail-git/) or [AUR stable](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bubblejail/)
1. Install the application you want to sandbox (for example, firefox)
1. Run GUI. (should be found under name `Bubblejail Configuration`)
1. Press 'Create instance' button at the bottom.
1. Select a profile. (for example, firefox)
1. Optionally change name
1. Press 'Create'
1. The new instance is created along with new desktop entry.

## Command-line utility documentation

See man page:

[man 1 bubblejail](https://github.com/igo95862/bubblejail/blob/master/docs/man/bubblejail.rst)

### Usage examples

#### Create new instance using firefox profile

`bubblejail create --profile firefox FirefoxInstance`

#### Run instance

`bubblejail run FirefoxInstance`

#### Create a generic instance without a desktop entry

`bubblejail create --no-desktop-entry --profile generic Test`
