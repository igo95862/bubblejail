# ![](data/bubblejail-config.svg) Bubblejail

Bubblejail is a [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap)-based alternative to Firejail.

## Description

Bubblejail's design is based on observations of Firejail's faults.

One of the biggest issues with Firejail is that you can accidentally run unsandboxed applications and not notice.

Bubblejail, instead of trying to transparently overlay an existing home directory, creates a separate home directory.

Every **Instance** represents a separate home directory. Typically, every sandboxed application has its own home directory.

Each instance has a `services.toml` file which defines the configuration of the instance such as system resources that the sandbox should have access to.

**Service** represents some system resources that the sandbox can be given access to. For example, the Pulse Audio service gives access to the Pulse Audio socket so that the application can use sound.

**Profile** is a predefined set of services that a particular application uses. Using profiles is entirely optional.

[Alpine Linux](docs/distro_notes/alpine.md)

[Ubuntu](docs/distro_notes/ubuntu.md)

### Manual Installation

If your distro does not have a package you can try to manually install with meson

#### Requirements

##### Build requirements
* Python 3 (>= 3.11) - python interpreter
* Jinja2 - Python template engine used during build
* Meson - build system
* scdoc - man page generator (optional)

##### Runtime requirements
* Python 3 (>= 3.11) - python interpreter
* Python PyXDG - XDG standards for python
* Python Tomli-W - writer part of `tomli`
* Bubblewrap (>= 0.5.0) - sandboxing command line utility
* XDG D-Bus Proxy - filtering D-Bus proxy
* Python Qt6 - for GUI
* libseccomp - helper library for seccomp rules
* [python-lxns](https://github.com/igo95862/python-lxns) - Linux kernel namespaces library for Python

##### Runtime highly recommended dependencies
* Desktop File Utils - allows new desktop entries to be registered
* notify-send - command to send desktop notification (part of `libnotify`)

##### Optional
* bash-completion - auto-completions for bash shell
* fish - auto-completions for fish shell
* slirp4netns - for alternative networking stack

#### Using meson to install

1. Run `meson setup build` to setup build directory
1. Switch to build directory `cd build`
1. Compile `meson compile`
1. Install `sudo meson install`

If you want to uninstall run `sudo ninja uninstall` from build directory.

## Quick start

1. Install bubblejail from [AUR git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bubblejail-git/) or [AUR stable](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bubblejail/)
1. Install the application you want to sandbox (for example, firefox)
1. Run GUI. (should be found under name `Bubblejail Configuration`)
1. Press 'Create instance' button at the bottom.
1. Select a profile. (for example, firefox)
1. Optionally change name
1. Press 'Create'
1. The new instance is created along with new desktop entry.

### Usage examples

#### Create new instance using firefox profile

`bubblejail create --profile firefox FirefoxInstance`

#### Run instance

`bubblejail run FirefoxInstance`

#### Create a generic instance without a desktop entry

`bubblejail create --no-desktop-entry --profile generic Test`

See following wiki guides on how to setup bubblejail if a particular application
does not have a profile:

* [Example: setting up Torbrowser](../../wiki/Example:-setting-up-Torbrowser)
* [Re‐using profiles for similar applications. Example with qutebrowser and chromium.](../../wiki/Re‐using-profiles-for-similar-applications.-Example-with-qutebrowser-and-chromium.)
